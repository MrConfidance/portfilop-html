<p>
    One of the most intriguing series I've ever seen. <br />
    It tells the story of a post-apocalyptic world where every human on the planet has lost the ability to see. 
    <br />They have been living like this for hundreds of years until the first child is born with the ability to see.

<h3>The Boys</h3>

<p>
    Not much to say about it, but it's funny. <br />
    It tells a story about a world with real superheroes, but the joke is that superheroes are just like normal people.
    <br /> In reality, if there were any superheroes in our world, they would be something like them. Must-watch!
</p>
<h3>The Foundation</h3>

<p>
    The story is set in the galaxy 20,500 years from now. <br />
    There are skyscrapers hundreds of kilometers high, spaceships, inhabited planets, and many other exciting things.
    <br /> This is one of my favorite series of all time, and the second season has just been released!
